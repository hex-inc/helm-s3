## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The plugin is now also distributed as Docker images. Images are pushed to Docker Hub tagged with plugin release 
version and suffixed with Helm version. The image built from master branch is also available, note that it should be
only used for playing and testing, it is **strongly discouraged** to use that image for production use cases. 
Refer to https://hub.docker.com/r/hex-inc/helm-s3 for details and all available tags.

### Changed

[Refs: [#57](https://github.com/hex-inc/helm-s3/issues/57) [#58](https://github.com/hex-inc/helm-s3/pull/58)] @kylehodgetts

- Default Content-Type for uploaded charts is set to `application/gzip`.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Added global `--acl` flag to address issues for setups with multiple Amazon 
accounts. Thanks to [@razaj92](https://github.com/razaj92) for the Pull Request!
[Ref: [#37](https://github.com/hex-inc/helm-s3/issues/37)]
- Added `--dry-run` flag to `helm s3 push` command. It simulates a push, but doesn't 
actually touch anything. This option is useful, for example, to indicate if 
a chart upload would fail due to the version not being changed. 
[Ref: [#44](https://github.com/hex-inc/helm-s3/issues/44)]
- Added `--ignore-if-exists` flag to `helm s3 push` command. It allows to exit 
normally without triggering an error if the pushed chart already exists. A clean
exit code may be useful to avoid some error management in the CI/CD. 
[Ref: [#41](https://github.com/hex-inc/helm-s3/issues/41)]

### Changed

- Moved `helm s3 reindex` command out of beta, as it seems there are no more 
issues related to it.
